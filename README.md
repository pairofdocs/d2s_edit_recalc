# D2S Save File Editor (LoD and D2R)


## Features
- Reset the cowking quest so the portal can be opened after killing the king (Norm, NM, and Hell)
- Reset the izual quest
- Reset the hell forge quest
- Reset the larzuk item socket quest


## Usage
1. Place your d2 character save file (MyAwesomeChar.d2s) in the same folder as the executable `edit_and_recalc.exe`
2. Edit `patches.txt` for quests that you want to reset by commenting/uncommenting specific lines
3. Double click `edit_and_recalc.exe`
4. Move your edited savefile back to `Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected Tech Alpha\` and start D2

**Note**: The first time `edit_and_recalc.exe` is run, it creates a backup file of your save file called `MyAwesomeChar.d2s.bak`. 
This backup can be moved/copied and used if you want to undo any changes.
